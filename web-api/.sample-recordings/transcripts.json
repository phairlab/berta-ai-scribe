So, based on what we talked about from your swelling as well as breathlessness while laying down in your past history of a heart attack and high cholesterol, it may be likely with the medications you're on as well as your history that you might be having what's called a congestive heart failure. So, we will need to do further investigations to determine if that is what it is and if we need to get you on something like Lasix or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid that's building up in your body which may be caused by heart failure. So, we'll do some investigations and then go from there. Okay.",

Um, just resting it right now. It feels fine. It's okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm going to, if I think of any more questions specifically about your leg, I will, uh, I'll go back to it, but, uh, I'm going to just move on and ask you a few questions about your overall health. Um, you've already shared with me that you, you are diabetic. Do you have any other chronic conditions that you live with? Chronic condition? Uh, see the family doctor, family doc about, uh, cholesterol, want a pill for that. Um, uh, had asthma as a kid, not too much of an issue now. And, uh, my back, I've had back pain for the last 10 years, but I don't know. All I really take for his Tylenol Advil for that. Okay. Oh, my other question about your leg was, uh, have you lost any feeling in it? It kind of, it's like a dull ache sometimes when I touch it, but no, I like in the area, the ankle, no, but definitely on my feet, like over the years I've noticed I feel less on it compared to what I did previously.

I've taken four pills right now. Um, one of them is for the cholesterol. I think it's called Resuva, Resuva statin. Um, the other three, they're all diabetes medications, but I don't remember.

Yeah, we'll definitely do that for you. Uh, so yeah, I'm going to have a look at it. And then after that, I will go talk to the doctor that I'm working with and, uh, we'll see what we can do for you.

Okay, so but in terms of range of motion, did you have less and less range of motion with that stiffness or pain over the years? I think so, yes. Have you seen a physiotherapist to try to straighten things out? Yes. Okay, and what happened with that? It was not effective because they would try to work the muscles in the joints above and below, but because I got an ultrasound actually and there's a floating piece of bone in there. Oh, I see. 6 millimeters, so I don't know if that's stopping my extension. Yeah, okay. Do you have other medical problems in your history? I have diabetes and I have high blood pressure.

No, I think you covered everything. Thank you. Okay, yeah, no worry. So I guess at this point we would do a physical exam, just take a listen to your lungs and your chest after that. So right now it sounds like it could be something vascular, you know, like a pulmonary embolism like we talked about. That's kind of high on my list of things to work up for, but also we don't want to miss other things, you know, like cancer, infection, autoimmune things that could affect your lungs. So we'll just do a workup for all of that. How does that sound? Yeah, whatever you think we need to do. Okay, sounds good. Thank you for your time. Yeah, thanks.",

Okay, I see, and so in regards to past health, has he had any symptoms or like this before? I guess last month he kind of had similar symptoms, and they said it was a viral infection, so he was just given some puffers to help his breathing, and he got better on his own. Okay, did they tell you what the diagnosis was at that time, or just say that it was a viral infection? No, they said it could be bronchiolitis or just an upper viral infection. Okay, any reasons for hospitalizations? At that time that he had the bronchiolitis or viral infection, he was hospitalized for two days just to help his breathing. Okay, and any medications that he takes regularly or uses regularly? No, no. Okay, any allergies to medications that you're aware of? No. Okay, and in regards to prenatal history, were there any complications throughout pregnancy? No, I wouldn't say so, no. It was normal, everything was normal, and he was a healthy baby.

Okay, and does anybody, is there any congenital diseases that run in the family? No, no. Okay, how about any genetic diseases? No. Okay, and so it's sounding like we'll want to do a workup for his symptoms right now for breathing heavily and with the fever that's concerning for a type of infection, and with being under three months, it would warrant some investigations, so we'd want to check, do some blood tests and check his cerebrospinal fluid as well to make sure that there's no infection in the brain, I guess, and we'll kind of go from there. Sure, yeah, that sounds good. Okay, in the meantime, yeah, we'll give you some inhalers and keep the oxygen on to help with the lungs and the breathing and then keep monitoring for how he's doing symptomatically. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Was there anything else that I missed to ask about? No, I don't think so. Okay, that sounds good.

Okay, good. And how far along were you when you delivered him? It was a vaginal delivery just after 38 weeks. Okay, so he was full term. And you said vaginal delivery. Did they have to induce you at all? No. No. Okay. And was he a normal birth weight? Yeah, he was. Yeah, I think he was like just over three kilograms. Okay, good. And was he healthy after birth? Did he have any breathing issues, jaundice, anything like that? No breathing issues or jaundice. He came home with us right away. Okay. Okay. And then after that point to now, has he been normal in terms of his weight, height, head circumference? Yeah, he's been growing normally and eating well up to this point. Okay. And I should ask, has he been hitting all his milestones? Like, is he doing the things that his peers are doing? Yeah, I would say he's keeping up with his peers in daycare and no concerns with his development. Okay, good. Is he on any medications? No medications. No. Okay. And is he up to date with all his immunizations? He is, yes. Okay. And any allergies? Not that we're aware of. Okay. Any family history of lung conditions? No, no family history of any lung conditions. Okay. And so who does he live with at home? So he lives with myself and his father and then sister. So there's just the four of us at home. Okay. And what's the relationship like between all of you? Any domestic issues or are things okay? Oh, things are great at home. It's a really supportive environment. Okay, good. And does anyone smoke at home? No one smokes at home. No. Okay. Any carpets at home? Old carpets? I think there's a few area rugs around, but most of the carpets are gone. Okay. Okay. All right. So it sounds like from what you're telling me, he. Oh, sorry, I should have asked you this earlier. Has he had any issues breathing? No problems breathing, but his voice does sound a bit, a little bit off, a bit husky. A bit husky. Okay. All right. And nothing like a seizure, like a febrile seizure, right? No, I haven't seen any like limb jerking or anything like that. Okay. So just roughly doing from the sounds of it, it sounds like he has a sore throat that's been persistent. And we do this thing called a Centaur score. So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, sore throat. So the first thing that we'd want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat. And then, well, if that comes back negative, we'll go from there and think about other viral causes for a strep throat as well. Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today? No, we were thinking that it could be maybe strep throat. So, yeah, thank you. Okay, great. Thank you."
