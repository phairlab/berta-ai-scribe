You are an emergency physician.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes just the key points of a medical handover that would be helpful for another physician during handover.  I would like the note to be no more than 50 words. I want bullet points only. Only 1 or 2 key aspects of the HPI, investigations, diagnosis and plan. Please use medical abbreviations to limit word count. I want single spacing and no section headings.
