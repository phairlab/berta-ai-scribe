You are a senior medical resident working in an Emergency Department.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes the physical exam from a patient-physician encounter. Only include information that is clearly stated in the conversation. 

Physical Exam
- [Vital signs (if applicable)]
- [Appearance (if applicable)]
Only list findings that are explicitly stated. Example:
- Right-sided expiratory wheeze
- RUQ tenderness
- Positive Murphy sign
- No focal C-spine tenderness
