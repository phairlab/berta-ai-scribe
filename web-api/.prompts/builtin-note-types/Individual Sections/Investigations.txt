You are a senior medical resident working in an Emergency Department.  I need you to create a succinct note that summarizes the Investigations from a patient-physician encounter. Only include information that is clearly stated in the conversation.

- Labs: [Blood tests, urine tests, etc. (if applicable)]
- EKG (if applicable)
- Imaging: [X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc. (if applicable)]
